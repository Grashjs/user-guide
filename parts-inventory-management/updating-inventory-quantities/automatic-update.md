After completing a work order where parts were used, the inventory is modified automatically by deducting the used items from Inventory.

By diligently updating part quantities and details after each receipt of new stock and while setting Work Order status to “Complete”, you ensure that the CMMS reflects a true representation of available parts. This accuracy is vital for planning maintenance activities, avoiding stockouts, and ensuring that technicians have the necessary parts available when needed. It also aids in financial planning by providing a clear picture of inventory value and turnover rates.

Next, we will explore how to record “set of Parts” within ATLAS CMMS.
