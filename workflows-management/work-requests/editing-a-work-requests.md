In the Atlas CMMS, the ability to edit a work request depends on the user's role and the current status of the request. This chapter will explain the permissions and limitations related to editing work requests.

As the creator of a work request, the Requester has the ability to edit the request details under certain conditions:

1. __Pending Status__: If the work request is still in the "Pending" status, meaning it has not yet been responded to by an Admin or Limited Admin, the Requester has full permission to edit the request details.
2. __Editing Pending Requests__: To edit a pending work request, the Requester should navigate to the Work Requests list, locate the specific request they want to modify, and open its details. From there, they can click on the "Edit" button to access the request editing form.
3. __Modifying Request Details__: In the editing form, the Requester can modify various fields of the work request, such as the title, description, priority, due date, location, asset, and attached images or documents. They can make necessary changes or add additional information to clarify the maintenance need.
4. __Saving Changes__: After making the desired modifications, the Requester should click the "Save" button to update the work request details. The changes will be immediately reflected in the system.

It is important to note that the Requester's ability to edit a work request is limited to the "Pending" status. Once an Admin or Limited Admin has responded to the request by either approving and assigning a work order or rejecting the request, the Requester can no longer edit the original request details.
