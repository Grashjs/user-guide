##### Definition and Purpose

Work Requests, also known as Maintenance Requests or simply Requests, are a fundamental component of a CMMS.

They serve as the initial step in the maintenance workflow, allowing various stakeholders to formally communicate and document the need for maintenance, repair, or improvement work.

At its core, a Work Request is a solicitation for maintenance services. It captures essential details about the issue or task, such as the location, affected asset, problem description, and requestor information. Work Requests provide a standardized method for collecting and organizing maintenance needs from multiple sources.

##### Relationship to Work Orders

It's important to understand the relationship and distinction between Work Requests and Work Orders in a CMMS:

- A Work Request is the initial request for maintenance service. It identifies a need but does not yet authorize or schedule the work.
- A Work Order, on the other hand, is a formal instruction to perform maintenance work. It is created based on an approved Work Request and includes additional details like assigned technician, scheduled date, and specific tasks.

In essence, Work Requests are inputs to the maintenance process, while Work Orders are the actionable outputs. Not all Work Requests will necessarily result in Work Orders, as some may be duplicates, low priority, or handled through other means.

##### Work Requests in Atlas CMMS

In Atlas CMMS, the Work Request functionality is designed to be highly accessible and user\-friendly. The system allows a wide range of maintenance stakeholders to submit Work Requests, not just limited to the maintenance team.

This open approach empowers all users, including machine operators, production supervisors, facilities managers, or even office staff, to easily report maintenance needs as they arise.

For example, consider a manufacturing plant where a machine operator notices unusual vibration on a critical piece of equipment. In Atlas CMMS, that operator can quickly submit a Work Request right from the shop floor using a mobile device. They can include a description of the issue, identify the specific machine, and even attach a photo or video to clarify the problem.

This Work Request is then routed to the appropriate maintenance planner or supervisor, who can review it, ask for additional information if needed, and decide whether to create a Work Order for further action. Throughout the process, the requestor receives updates on the status of their request.

By making the Work Request process inclusive and easy to use, Atlas CMMS helps capture maintenance needs from all corners of the organization, leading to more timely issue identification, better\-informed maintenance decisions, and ultimately, improved asset reliability and performance.
