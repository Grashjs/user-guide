Meters in Atlas CMMS refer to counters or gauges that measure usage, consumption, or wear of an asset. They track a numeric value over time, such as hours of operation, pieces produced, miles driven, or fuel consumed. Meters serve two main purposes in the CMMS:

1. Recording meter readings and maintaining a historical log of those readings over time. This allows for tracking asset utilization and performance.
2. Setting up conditions based on meter readings that can automatically trigger preventive maintenance work orders when certain thresholds are reached. This enables usage\-based maintenance scheduling.
