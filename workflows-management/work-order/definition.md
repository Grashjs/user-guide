Manual Work Orders are work orders initiated manually by users to address various types of maintenance tasks.

They often cover maintenance tasks that have not been previously scheduled, such as corrective maintenance for unexpected repairs like fixing a malfunctioning conveyor belt or replacing a burnt\-out motor.

Additionally, manual work orders can be used for a range of unscheduled maintenance tasks, including emergency safety inspections following incidents, ad\-hoc equipment upgrades to integrate new technology, compliance audits required by sudden regulatory changes, preparatory maintenance for special operations or events, unexpected part replacements due to accelerated wear and tear, and environmental adjustments necessitated by updated regulations. These applications underscore the flexibility and importance of manual work orders in maintaining operational readiness and compliance.

In the upcoming chapters, we will delve into the workflow of manual work orders \(referred to by Work Order or WO in present chapter\) within Atlas CMMS.
