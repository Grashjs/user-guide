Labor costs refer to the expenses incurred for the time and effort of technicians or workers involved in executing a work order. Accurately tracking and accounting for labor costs is crucial for several reasons:

1. __Realistic Cost Estimation__: By capturing all labor costs associated with a work order, organizations can develop more accurate cost estimates for future maintenance projects, leading to better budgeting and resource allocation.
2. __Profitability Analysis__: Labor costs directly impact the profitability of a work order. Tracking these costs allows for better analysis of job profitability and identification of areas for process optimization.
3. __Billing and Payroll__: For service providers, labor costs are directly tied to billing clients. For internal teams, they impact payroll calculations.

__Common Use Cases for Adding Labor__

- __Work Started At__: The date and time when the labor effort began.
- __Category__: The category or type of labor being added. Refer to the "Labor Categories" chapter for a list of predefined categories in Atlas CMMS.
