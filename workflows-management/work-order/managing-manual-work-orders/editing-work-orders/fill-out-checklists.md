In Atlas CMMS, filling out a maintenance checklist is a critical step in ensuring that all tasks associated with a work order are completed thoroughly and accurately. This chapter will guide you through the process of filling out a checklist and explain how the system automatically saves your inputs.

__Accessing the Checklist__

To begin filling out a checklist:

1. Navigate to the relevant work order within Atlas CMMS.
2. Locate the "Tasks" section, If the Work Order had Tasks or Checklists attached, this section will display the number of remaining tasks and your progress, as indicated by a progress bar.

__Completing Checklist Items__

Each task on the checklist may require a different type of response, such as selecting an item from a dropdown menu, entering a value, or marking a task as complete. Here's how to address each type:

1. __Dropdown Menu Tasks__: For tasks like "Safety signs and switches" or "Emergency stop button functionality," click on the dropdown menu to select the appropriate status or condition from the list of options provided.
2. __Value Input Tasks__: For tasks that require a specific measurement or value, such as "Bearing and pulley condition" or "Coolant level and radiator condition," enter the relevant data into the text field provided.
3. __Inspection Check Tasks__: For tasks that involve verification, such as "Loose wires or connections" or "Oil and fuel leaks," use the checkbox or selection icon to mark the task according to its completion status \(e.g., "Open," "In Progress," "On Hold," "Complete"\).
4. __Attachment Tasks__: If there is a need to attach documentation or images, use the download or attachment icon to upload the necessary files.

__Automatic Saving of Inputs__

As you fill out the checklist:

- The system automatically saves your inputs as soon as you make them. There is no need for an explicit save action, which streamlines the process and reduces the risk of data loss.
- You can confidently move from one task to another, knowing that your entries are securely recorded in real\-time.

__Sub\-Task Status__

Each task can also have a sub\-task status assigned to it, allowing you to indicate the current state of that particular task. This helps in tracking the progress of each item on the checklist and managing workflow more effectively.

__Leveraging the Checklist Function__

The checklist function in Atlas CMMS is designed to ensure that no step is overlooked during maintenance operations. By providing a clear and organized list of tasks with intuitive response modes and automatic saving, technicians can focus on the quality of their work without worrying about manual data entry or record\-keeping.

Upon completion of the checklist, the progress bar will reflect 100% completion, and the number of remaining tasks will update accordingly. This visual indicator provides immediate feedback on your progress and helps maintain momentum as you work through maintenance activities.

By utilizing the checklist feature in Atlas CMMS, maintenance teams can enhance their efficiency, ensure accuracy in their work, and maintain high standards of asset performance and safety.
