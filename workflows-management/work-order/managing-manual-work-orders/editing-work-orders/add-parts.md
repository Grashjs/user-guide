1. Enter the desired quantity in the provided field and click "Save" to confirm the changes.

__Stock Availability and Notifications__

Atlas CMMS will automatically check the stock availability for the selected parts:

1. If there is sufficient stock in the system, the part will be added to the work order and the inventory will be updated accordingly.
2. If the quantity available is not sufficient, Atlas CMMS will notify you with a message stating "Quantity cannot be changed." Means that actual inventory of the Part as set in Atlas CMMS, is not enough to respond to the desired quantity.

__Managing Parts Throughout the Work Order Lifecycle__

You can continue to change parts and their quantities as long as the work order status is not set to "Complete." This allows for flexibility in managing the work order as conditions change or additional needs arise.

By following these steps, you can efficiently add and manage parts for a work order in Atlas CMMS, ensuring that all necessary materials are accounted for and reserved for the maintenance task. This process helps maintain accurate inventory levels and supports effective work order execution.
