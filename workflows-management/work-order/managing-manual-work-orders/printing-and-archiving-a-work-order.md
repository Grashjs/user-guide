The ability to print work orders can be leveraged in several ways:

- Field Use: Technicians can carry printed work orders as a reference during maintenance tasks, especially in areas where digital device use is impractical or where there is no internet connectivity.
- Record\-Keeping: Keeping a physical or digital archive of work orders helps maintain a historical record of maintenance activities, which can be useful for audits, performance reviews, and planning future maintenance work.
- Compliance: Printed work orders can serve as proof of completed maintenance for regulatory compliance and warranty claims.
- Communication: Sharing printed work orders with team members or stakeholders can facilitate better communication and coordination, ensuring everyone is informed about the maintenance tasks and expectations.

__Work Order Lifecycle Printing__

Atlas CMMS allows users to print work orders at any stage of their lifecycle, from creation to completion. This ensures that users have access to the most up\-to\-date information at all times and can document the progression of maintenance activities.

- __At Creation__: Print the initial work order to begin the maintenance process.
- __During Updates__: Print updated work orders to reflect any changes or additional notes made during the execution of the task.
- __After Completion__: Print the final work order to include all details of the completed work, including any follow\-up actions or observations.

By utilizing the print function throughout the work order lifecycle, users can ensure that all relevant information is captured and accessible, both in digital and physical formats, enhancing the efficiency and traceability of maintenance operations within Atlas CMMS.
