1. __Primary Worker:__

- This is the main technician responsible for executing the work order tasks and seeing it through to completion, or the one who will delegate or handover this work order to other peers
- They have the overall accountability for the work order being completed satisfactorily, whether doing the work themselves or assigning it to others
- The primary worker is the main point of contact for updates on the work order status and progress
- They coordinate with additional workers and teams as needed to ensure all tasks are finished
- Example: Assigning the most experienced HVAC technician as the primary worker on a complex air conditioning system repair work order. They assess the work required and involve other technicians for specific tasks, but remain responsible for the final outcome.__ __

1. __Additional Workers__: If required, you can assign additional workers or technicians to participate with the work order:

- These are technicians who assist the primary worker in completing the work order, often with specialized skills
- They may be assigned to handle specific subtasks within the overall maintenance job
- Additional workers support the primary worker but are not directly accountable for the entire work order
- Example: Assigning an electrician and a plumber to assist the primary HVAC technician with rewiring and drainage tasks on the air conditioning repair work order

1. __Team__: Assign the work order to a specific team or department within your organization.

- This refers to a group of maintenance staff with collective responsibility for the work order, rather than a single individual
- Teams are often used for larger, multi\-disciplinary maintenance jobs that require coordination between different technicians and trades
- The team as a whole is accountable for the successful completion of the work order, with tasks delegated among team members
- Example: Assigning a facilities maintenance team consisting of HVAC, electrical, plumbing and carpentry technicians to handle a comprehensive building maintenance work order

1. __Contractors__: If the work order involves external contractors, you can specify their details in this field.
2. __Location__: Select the location or facility where the work needs to be performed.
3. __Asset__: If the work order is related to a specific asset or equipment, you can associate it with the work order by selecting it from the list. By Choosing the Location first, the Asset dropdown will show only Assets related to the already chosen location.
4. __Tasks/Checklists__: Optionally, you can create a checklist of tasks or tasks to be followed as part of the work order or you can choose among pre\-established checklists.\( See [Checklist Setting](../../initial-setup-and-configuration/setting/checklist-setting.md)\)
5. __Files Upload__: Similar to the image upload section, you can attach relevant files, documents, or manuals to the work order by dragging and dropping or browsing for the files.
6. __Requires Signature__: If the work order requires a signature upon completion, you can check this box and the related Work Order will not be set Complete before the Assigned User attach the Signature.

Once you have filled in all the necessary information, click the "Add" button to create the new manual work order in the system.

By following this process, you can ensure that all critical details are captured for the work order, facilitating efficient task assignment, scheduling, and execution within the maintenance management workflow.

##### Work Order Permissions and Notifications

Once a work order has been created, it is crucial to ensure that the right people are notified and have the appropriate permissions to act on the work order efficiently. This chapter will explain the various notifications and permissions associated with work orders, as well as the reasoning behind them.

![](../../static/img/image103.png)

Outcomes Legend:

- Permission: Permission to Do the Action.
- Web Push Notification: Get Push notification on Web interface after Action is done.
- Mobile Push Notification: Get Push notification on Web interface after Action is done.
- Mail Notification: Get E\-Mail notification after Action is done.
- Web interface: Get the immediate Web Interface View up\-date after Action is done.
- Mobile interface: Get the immediate Mobile Interface View up\-date after Action is done.

Refer to the table provided above, which outlines the actions, outcomes, and permissions for different user roles throughout the work order lifecycle.

###### <a id="_Permissions"></a>Permissions

The table outlines the permissions granted to different user roles for various actions related to work orders. These permissions are designed to maintain control, accountability, and security within the system.

1. __Work Order Creation__: Roles such as Admin, Limited Admin or Technician have the permission to create work orders, ensuring that only authorized personnel can initiate maintenance requests.
2. __Work Order Status update__: Technicians and limited technicians have the permission to change the status of work orders and \( In Progress, On Hold, Complete\).
3. __Work Order Deletion__: Only Admins have the permission to delete work orders, preventing accidental or unauthorized deletions.
4. __Work Order Assignment/Reassignment:__ Reassign Work Order refers to changing the assignment of the work order from one user \(Primary Worker, Team or any member the work order was Assigned To\) to another. This process is a fundamental aspect of managing maintenance operations dynamically, ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.

[\(see more details in Tip 2: Reassigning Work Order\)](../../tips-annexes/tip-2-reassigning-work-order.md)

###### Notifications

Cases of Notifications:

Once a work order is created, it is received by users depending on their assigned roles. Technicians and Limited Technicians are typically the recipients of work orders, as they are responsible for carrying out the maintenance tasks. They receive notifications and can view work order details through the web and mobile interfaces.

1. __Work Order Creation__: When a work order is created, notifications are sent to the relevant parties, such as the Admin, Limited Admin and the assigned User. This ensures that everyone is aware of the new work order and can take appropriate actions.
2. __Work Order Assignment/Reassignment__: When a work order is assigned or reassigned to a technician or team, notifications are sent to the assignee\(s\) and other relevant parties. This helps technicians stay informed about their workload and prioritize tasks accordingly.
3. __Work Order Updates__: As the work order progresses, notifications are sent to keep stakeholders updated on any changes in status, comments, or resource assignments. This transparency helps maintain accountability and facilitates effective communication.

Notifications are essential for maintaining a smooth workflow and ensuring that work orders are addressed promptly. They help minimize delays, miscommunications, and potential bottlenecks in the maintenance process.

Forms of Notifications:

In this chapter, we will explore the various forms of notifications that users can receive following the creation of a work order in Atlas CMMS. These notifications are designed to keep all relevant parties informed and up\-to\-date on the latest developments and assignments.

__Push Notifications on Web Application__

![](../../static/img/image104.png)

Upon the creation of a work order, relevant users will receive a push notification on their web application interface. An example of such a notification is shown above, where a small Green badge on the bell icon indicates that there are new notifications waiting to be reviewed. This visual cue prompts users to check their notifications for important updates.

__Bell Notifications__

![](../../static/img/image105.png)

When users click on the bell icon, as depicted above, they will see a list displaying their most recent notifications. This list includes details such as the type of notification \(e.g., work order assignments, status updates\), the subject of the notification \(e.g., "Daily check Motor vibration"\), and the time the notification was sent. Users can quickly scan through this list to get an overview of their pending tasks and any actions they need to take.

__Push Notifications on Mobile App__

Similar to web push notifications, mobile app notifications alert users to new work orders and updates. These notifications can appear even when the app is not actively in use, ensuring that users don't miss critical information. Tapping on the notification will typically take the user directly to the relevant work order or task within the app.

__Email Notifications__

![](../../static/img/image106.png)

The above shows an example of an email notification. Users will receive an email informing them of new work orders assigned to them, such as "Daily cleaning." The email includes a "See more details" button, which, when clicked, directs the user to the CMMS system where they can view the full work order details and take necessary action.

![](../../static/img/image107.png)

In addition to the various forms of notifications discussed earlier, another way for users to stay informed about the status of work orders is by viewing the number of open work orders in real\-time directly from the main menu of the application. As shown in the attached image, the "Work Orders" section displays a badge with the number "64," indicating that there are 64 open work orders currently in the system.

By utilizing these various forms of notifications, the Atlas CMMS system ensures that users are kept informed about new work orders and updates in real\-time, allowing for prompt responses and efficient management of maintenance tasks. Whether through web or mobile push notifications, bell notifications, or email alerts, the system provides a robust communication framework to support the maintenance workflow.

##### <a id="_Editing_Work_Order"></a>Editing Work Order

When a User receives a work order assignment notification \(by Mobile Push notifications, Web Push Notification and by e\-mail and once the User clicks on a specific work order assigned to them, they will be presented with a detailed view of that work order:

![](../../static/img/image108.png)

Upon receiving the work order assignment, the User will need to take the following steps:

1. __Start the timer:__ To track the time spent on the work order, the user must start the timer, which will record the labor hours dedicated to the task. See [Using The Timer Effectively](#using-the-timer-and-work-orders-status-effectively)
2. __Fill out checklists:__ If the work order includes specific checklists or task lists, the user will need to follow and complete these steps, documenting their progress along the way.
3. __Add labor information:__ As the user works on the task, they will need to record other labor hours spent. \(See [Time Categories](../../initial-setup-and-configuration/configurations/categories-configuration.md/#timer-categories) Chapter\).
4. __Order and add parts:__ If the work order requires the replacement or installation of parts, the technician can order the necessary parts and add them to the work order, ensuring that the required materials are available.
5. __Link related work orders:__ In some cases, a work order may be related to or dependent on another work order. The technician \(or the Admin, Limited Admin\) can link these work orders together for better tracking and coordination.For more details, see chapter about [Linked Work Orders role and use cases.](../../tips-annexes/tip-3-linking-work-orders.md)
6. __Update status and details:__ Throughout the process, the user should update the work order status and details to reflect the progress of the work, such as marking tasks as completed or adding notes and comments.
7. __Stop the timer and mark as complete:__ Once the work is fully completed, the user must stop the timer to accurately capture the total labor hours spent on the work order. Finally, they will mark the work order as "Complete," indicating that the task has been successfully accomplished.

By following this workflow, technicians and limited technicians can effectively manage and document their work order assignments, ensuring that maintenance tasks are carried out efficiently, accurately, and with proper tracking of labor, materials, and associated costs.

###### Using The Timer and Work Orders Status Effectively

<a id="_The_Timer"></a>The Timer

![](../../static/img/image109.png)

To track the time spent on a work order, the user shall start the __timer__ by clicking on ‚Äú__Run Timer__‚Äù, which will record the labor hours dedicated to the task.

It is recommended to use the timer to measure only the "wrench time" or the time actively spent working on the asset, as this provides an accurate representation of the added value to the work order.

Once the timer is started, the status of the work order will automatically be set to "In Progress," indicating that the maintenance task is currently underway.

![](../../static/img/image110.png)

While the work order is in progress, the user can pause, resume or stop the timer as needed. This flexibility allows for accurate time tracking, even if the work is interrupted or needs to be paused for any reason. Like that, the wrench time is measured accurately.

Update Work Order status:

On Hold Status:

![](../../static/img/image111.png)

Click on Status Dropdown button and choose ‚ÄúOn Hold‚Äù.

![](../../static/img/image112.png)

Users can manually change the status if necessary. For example, if a work order needs to be temporarily put on hold due to a lack of parts or other circumstances, the user can change the status to "On Hold" while stopping or keeping Timer running. This status change will pause the timer and downtime tracking until the work order is resumed.

Here are some relevant examples of when a user might need to manually change the work order status or stop the timer:

- __Parts on Backorder__: If a required part is on backorder, the user can set the work order status to "On Hold" and stop the timer until the part arrives, preventing inaccurate downtime tracking.
- __Shift Change__: When a maintenance technician's shift ends, they can stop the timer and set the status to "On Hold" and reassign to Work Order to the next shift that will resume the work order.
- __Unexpected Delays__: In case of unexpected delays, such as equipment breakdowns or safety incidents, the user can set the status to "On Hold" and stop the timer until the issue is resolved.

###### Fill out checklists:

###### Add labor information:

###### Order and add parts

###### Link related work orders:

###### Stop the timer and mark as complete:

###### Work Order Completion and Feedback

Once the work order is set to complete, a prompt will be opened for the user to provide feedback or additional information about the task.

![](../../static/img/image113.png)

This feedback can include details about the work performed, any issues encountered, 5Whys, Root Cause Analysis or recommendations for future maintenance.

If Timer kept running, upon submitting the feedback, the timer will automatically stop, and the work order status will be updated to "Complete," indicating that the asset is now back in service and ready for operation.

Important: Once Work Order Status is set to ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù, Work Order can no longer be Edited Except from an Admin Account.

By following these guidelines, users can effectively utilize work orders and timers to accurately track maintenance activities, monitor asset downtime, and ensure that maintenance records are up\-to\-date and comprehensive.

###### Reassign Work Order

To reassign a work order, access the work order record, click on the pencil icon shown in the image,

![](../../static/img/image114.png)

and navigate to 'Primary Worker' to assign a new primary worker, or 'Additional Workers' or ‚ÄòTeam‚Äô to add or change team members.

![](../../static/img/image115.png)

Enter the name of the new assignee, and press 'Save.' The new assignee will then receive a notification about the work order assignment.
