##### Consumed Parts Costs Graph
- The bar graph titled "Consumed Parts Costs" visualizes the cost of consumed parts over the specified period. The graph shows a significant increase in parts costs towards the end of the time period, as indicated by the tall yellow bar on the right side of the graph. This spike could suggest a large maintenance event, an increase in repair activities, or the purchase of a high-cost item.
