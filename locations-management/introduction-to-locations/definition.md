In the context of a Atlas CMMS, "Locations" refer to the physical areas, sites, or places where assets are installed or maintenance activities are performed.

Locations can range from broad geographical areas, such as buildings or campuses, to more specific areas within those broader locations, like rooms, floors, or even individual pieces of equipment. The concept of Locations within a CMMS helps organizations organize and track maintenance tasks, assets, and inventory more efficiently by associating them with specific physical areas.
