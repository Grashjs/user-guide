1. If applicable, specify the parent location to establish a hierarchical relationship.
2. During location creation, we can also assign workers, teams, vendors, and contractors to specific locations. Additionally, you have the option to attach pictures directly from your mobile camera or by dragging and dropping image files. Furthermore, you can attach relevant files to a location, such as floor plans, site maps, equipment manuals, or safety documents, which can provide valuable context and information for that particular location.

Note 1: Assigning workers, teams, vendors, and contractors to locations is beneficial for several reasons:

- It helps establish clear responsibilities and accountability for maintenance tasks at each location.
- It enables efficient work order assignment and resource allocation based on location.
- It supports location\-specific reporting and analysis of maintenance activities.
- Attaching pictures can be useful for visually documenting the layout, equipment, or specific areas of a location, aiding in better understanding and communication.

1. Once all necessary details are provided, click "Save" or "Create" to add the new location.

###### Importing from Template

1. Download the location template from the Atlas CMMS website under "Import Templates".

1. Either drag and drop the filled template file or select it from your device.
2. Follow the prompts to complete the import process successfully.
3. After importing, click the refresh button near the three vertical dots to view the imported locations.

It is crucial to start with parent locations before listing child locations when filling out the template. This is because the CMMS system relies on a hierarchical structure to organize and manage locations effectively.

By defining parent locations first, you establish the top\-level locations in the hierarchy. Child locations can then be nested under their respective parent locations, reflecting the real\-world relationships and dependencies between different facilities or sites.

Maintaining this hierarchical structure ensures proper data organization, enables efficient navigation and filtering of locations, and supports accurate reporting and analysis based on location hierarchies. It also allows for easier maintenance and updates, as changes to a parent location can be propagated to its child locations as needed.

#### Modifying Existing Location Details
