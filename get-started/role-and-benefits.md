This table highlights the diverse range of stakeholders involved in maintenance operations and how a CMMS like ATLAS can benefit each role by providing relevant access, capabilities, and insights. By understanding these role-based benefits, organizations can better engage their teams, streamline processes, and unlock the full potential of their CMMS investment.
In addition to the pre-configured default roles like Admin, Technician, Requester etc., ATLAS CMMS provides administrators with the flexibility to create customized roles tailored to their organization's specific needs. (See Chapter xxx)
