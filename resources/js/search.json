According to a report by Plant Engineering, companies that implement CMMS solutions can experience a 35% reduction in maintenance costs and a 28% increase in labor productivity.[1] Additionally, a study by Deloitte found that organizations using CMMS software can reduce equipment downtime by up to 20%.[2] The benefits of CMMS are substantial. A CMMS provides a centralized platform for managing work orders, scheduling preventive maintenance, tracking inventory, and analyzing asset performance data. This streamlined approach to maintenance management can lead to significant cost savings and increased operational efficiency. For example, a study by the Aberdeen Group revealed that best-in-class organizations using CMMS solutions achieved an average of 87% overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), compared to 77% for those not using CMMS.[3] This improvement in OEE translates directly into increased productivity and profitability. Furthermore, a report by Gartner estimates that companies can reduce their maintenance costs by up to 25% by implementing a CMMS solution and optimizing their maintenance processes.[4] This cost reduction can be attributed to factors such as reduced downtime, improved inventory management, and better resource allocation. In addition to cost savings and increased productivity, CMMS solutions also contribute to improved compliance and safety. A study by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) found that companies using CMMS software experienced a 9% reduction in workplace incidents and injuries.[5] This not only enhances worker safety but also helps organizations avoid costly fines and legal liabilities. Overall, the benefits of implementing a CMMS solution are well-documented and supported by numerous studies and reports. By leveraging the capabilities of a CMMS, organizations can streamline their maintenance operations, reduce downtime, cut costs, and improve compliance, ultimately leading to increased profitability and operational excellence.[1] Plant Engineering, [2] Deloitte, [3] Aberdeen Group, [4] Gartner, [5] Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)."]}],[{"l":"Training Matrix","p":["Atlas CMMS Training Matrix is designed to guide different user roles through the specific chapters or paragraphs of the Atlas User Guide that are most relevant to their responsibilities and access levels.

It details the necessary steps, assigns personnel, schedules the activity, and allocates required resources. Work orders in a CMMS are used to efficiently track, manage, and document maintenance operations, ensuring tasks are executed according to plan and maintaining a historical record of all maintenance activities. There are two types of work orders:","Manual Work Orders: There are user-initiated Work Orders that specifies a maintenance task not generated by automatic triggers. It allows for the scheduling and documenting of ad-hoc or unexpected maintenance activities.","Automatic Work Orders: These are work orders generated automatically based on predefined triggers or conditions.","Preventive Maintenance: These are scheduled maintenance tasks that are performed at regular intervals to prevent equipment failure and maintain optimal performance.","Condition-Based Maintenance: These are maintenance tasks that are triggered when certain conditions or thresholds are met, such as when a meter reading reaches a specific value.","Meter: These are measurements or readings taken from equipment or assets to monitor their condition and performance. Meter readings can be used to trigger condition-based maintenance tasks.","Work Requests: A work request is a communication tool used by employees or facility users to notify the maintenance department of a perceived need for repair or maintenance. Anyone within the organization can submit a work request when they observe malfunctioning equipment, safety issues, or general maintenance needs. The purpose of a work request is to inform the appropriate personnel about potential issues so that they can be evaluated and, if necessary, scheduled for maintenance through a formal work order.","In the following chapter, our focus will be on managing manual work orders, from the perspective of several roles, and in next chapters, we will discuss the management of other types of work orders, such as preventive maintenance or those triggered by a meter."]}],[{"l":"Definition","p":["Manual Work Orders are work orders initiated manually by users to address various types of maintenance tasks.","They often cover maintenance tasks that have not been previously scheduled, such as corrective maintenance for unexpected repairs like fixing a malfunctioning conveyor belt or replacing a burnt-out motor.","Additionally, manual work orders can be used for a range of unscheduled maintenance tasks, including emergency safety inspections following incidents, ad-hoc equipment upgrades to integrate new technology, compliance audits required by sudden regulatory changes, preparatory maintenance for special operations or events, unexpected part replacements due to accelerated wear and tear, and environmental adjustments necessitated by updated regulations.

Work Requests provide a standardized method for collecting and organizing maintenance needs from multiple sources."]},{"l":"Relationship to Work Orders","p":["It's important to understand the relationship and distinction between Work Requests and Work Orders in a CMMS:","A Work Request is the initial request for maintenance service. It identifies a need but does not yet authorize or schedule the work.","A Work Order, on the other hand, is a formal instruction to perform maintenance work. It is created based on an approved Work Request and includes additional details like assigned technician, scheduled date, and specific tasks.","In essence, Work Requests are inputs to the maintenance process, while Work Orders are the actionable outputs. Not all Work Requests will necessarily result in Work Orders, as some may be duplicates, low priority, or handled through other means."]},{"l":"Work Requests in Atlas CMMS","p":["In Atlas CMMS, the Work Request functionality is designed to be highly accessible and user-friendly. The system allows a wide range of maintenance stakeholders to submit Work Requests, not just limited to the maintenance team.","This open approach empowers all users, including machine operators, production supervisors, facilities managers, or even office staff, to easily report maintenance needs as they arise.","For example, consider a manufacturing plant where a machine operator notices unusual vibration on a critical piece of equipment. In Atlas CMMS, that operator can quickly submit a Work Request right from the shop floor using a mobile device. They can include a description of the issue, identify the specific machine, and even attach a photo or video to clarify the problem.","This Work Request is then routed to the appropriate maintenance planner or supervisor, who can review it, ask for additional information if needed, and decide whether to create a Work Order for further action. Throughout the process, the requestor receives updates on the status of their request.","By making the Work Request process inclusive and easy to use, Atlas CMMS helps capture maintenance needs from all corners of the organization, leading to more timely issue identification, better-informed maintenance decisions, and ultimately, improved asset reliability and performance."]}],[{"l":"Accessing Work Requests","p":["To access the Work Requests menu, follow these steps:","From the main application interface, locate the left-side navigation menu.","Click on the \"Requests\" menu item.","You will notice a number displayed next to the \"Requests\" menu item.
