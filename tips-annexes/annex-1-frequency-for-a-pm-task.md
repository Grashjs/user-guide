---

In the context of setting the frequency for preventive maintenance tasks, various sources can dictate or influence how often these tasks should be performed. Below a list of sources that can influence the determination of preventive maintenance frequencies:

1. **Manufacturer Recommendations**: Often, the equipment manufacturer will provide guidelines on maintenance intervals based on optimal operating conditions and engineering tests.
2. **Historical Data**: Analysis of maintenance records and failure histories of similar equipment can provide insights into the most effective frequencies for preventive maintenance tasks.
3. **Benchmarking**: Comparing maintenance practices and frequencies with those of other organizations in the same industry can help align preventive maintenance schedules with industry standards.
4. **Regulatory Requirements**: Certain industries are governed by safety and operational regulations that may dictate specific maintenance frequencies to ensure compliance.
5. **Operational Usage**: The frequency and intensity of equipment usage can also dictate maintenance needs. Heavily used equipment might require more frequent checks and maintenance.
6. **Predictive Maintenance Technologies**: Tools and technologies that monitor equipment condition in real-time (like vibration analysis, thermal imaging, and fluid analysis) can inform maintenance needs and optimize maintenance frequency based on actual equipment condition rather than predefined schedules.

By considering inputs from these varied sources, organizations can develop a more comprehensive and effective preventive maintenance schedule that enhances equipment reliability and efficiency.
