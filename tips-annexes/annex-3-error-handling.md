While the Atlas CMMS application is designed to be robust and user-friendly, you may occasionally encounter errors or unexpected behavior. In such situations, it's important to follow proper error handling procedures to ensure that the issue is addressed promptly and effectively.

1. **Taking a Screenshot**

If you encounter an error message or unexpected behavior, the first step is to take a screenshot. A screenshot captures the exact error message or state of the application at the time of the issue, providing valuable information for the support team to diagnose and resolve the problem.

2. **Noting the Action**

In addition to the screenshot, make a note of the specific action you were performing when the error occurred. This could include:

- The page or section of the application you were working in
- The data you were trying to input or modify
- The sequence of steps you followed before the error appeared
- Providing this context helps the support team understand the circumstances surrounding the issue, enabling them to better diagnose and resolve the problem.

3. **Contacting Support**

After capturing the screenshot and noting the relevant details, the next step is to contact the Atlas CMMS support team. You can reach out to them through the following channels:

- Live Chat: Access the live chat feature within the application by clicking on the chat icon in the bottom-right corner.
- Email: [contact@atlas-cmms.com]

When contacting support, be sure to include the following information:
a. The screenshot of the error message or unexpected behavior
b. A detailed description of the action you were performing when the issue occurred
c. Any additional context or information that may be relevant to the issue

The support team will review the provided information and work with you to resolve the error or issue as quickly as possible.

By following these error handling procedures, you can ensure that any issues you encounter are addressed efficiently, minimizing disruptions to your workflow and enabling you to continue using the Atlas CMMS application effectively.
